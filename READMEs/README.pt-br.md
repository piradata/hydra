### Project Structure

- src/renderer: the UI of the application
- src/main: all the logic rests here.

## Build from source

### Install Node.js

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Install Yarn

Yarn is a package manager for Node.js. If you haven't installed Yarn yet, you can do so by following the instructions on [yarnpkg.com](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

### Install Node Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the Node dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
cd hydra
yarn
```

### Install Python 3.9

Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3919/).

### Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment variables

You'll need an SteamGridDB API Key in order to fetch the game icons on installation.
If you want to have onlinefix as a repacker you'll need to add your credentials to the .env

Once you have it, you can copy or rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`and put it on`STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY`, `ONLINEFIX_USERNAME`, `ONLINEFIX_PASSWORD`.

## Running

Once you've got all things set up, you can run the following command to start both the Electron process and the bittorrent client:

```bash
yarn dev
```
